# Induction on the Natural Numbers

Coming soon: Entry about Induction on the Natural Numbers. 

##### Acknowledgments and Code

I came to terms with this content by playing the [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/), read [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/), browsing [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4), and asking questions on [Proof Assistants Stack Exchange](https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/). Thank you to everyone involved in each of those projects. 


All of the code covered in this entry of Babel can be found [here](https://github.com/SyntakticSugar/mathematics/blob/master/Mathematics/Number/Natural/arithmetic.lean) on my GitHub account.
