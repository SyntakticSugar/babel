title: Babel Blogging about Formal Mathematics
date: 2024-08-09
---

My aim with this blog is to document the development of a small library of mathematics formalised in Lean. 
Explaining the mathematics and coding choices along the way. Most of the code I write is inspired by browsing both
[Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) and the [Agda Standard Library](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib).
As this library is for study purposes, the other two libraries will always be far more substantial. 
If you're interested in writing proofs of even slightly sophisticated mathematics, then it is best to build on those 
libraries linked above. 

Primarily the posts will be about writing mathematics in Lean. However, I am also interested in logic and type theory. I will also 
write blogs about these and how they gave rise to the software we use today; such as Lean and Agda.  

I don't intend to follow any particular schedule. I will just write when the inspiration comes and time is available to me.
