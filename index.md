Babel: Library of Formal Mathematics
---

I am blogging my work formalising mathematics in Lean. This is to help me understand the process and explain the choices made throughout the development of the library. I am taking a lot of inspiration and code ideas directly from [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) and the [Agda Standard Library](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib). I make no claim of any novelty in this library, it is here purely for study and explanation. Helping myself, but maybe some readers too!

If you have found yourself here and want to comment on what I am doing, then please feel free to do so. Any criticism and clarifications are welcome.
